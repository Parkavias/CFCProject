  <h2>A technology for finding hospitals during the pandemic</h2>

  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p><strong>What's the problem?</strong><br>
   During the global pandemic Covid-19,<br/>It has become critical for pregnant ladies and common man seeking medical help to find hospitals for general health issues.<br/>People who are new to a location or stuck at different places find it very difficult to find the directions to hospitals from their locations.<br/> People with less English knowledge might not be able to use the exact phrases for google search.<br/>Some people only need first aid of some general illness by mentioning their symptoms.
  </p> 

  <p><strong>How can technology help?</strong><br>
    As this pandemic situation has created a lot of chaos in identifying the hospitals, we can guide people with the technology and help them in identifying and locating the nearby hospitals during emergency situations. We can also let the people know the symptoms, first aid and medicines for the general illness. So that even before they could reach the hospital they could do some first aid for the patients well in advance. Chatbots could be a boon and very helpful in such cases and to people with less English knowledge who find it difficult in using exact phrases for google search. 
  </p> 

  <p><strong>The idea
To overcome all these problem, we are going to configure a chatbot in IBM Cloud that helps people to feed their location and find nearby hospitals at their convenience, give directions to the hospitals to people who are new to that locality.
